#+TITLE: Santabot

Automate your secret santa game with the power of lisp!

* Configuring

Each participant can have their own list of /exclusions/ - that is,
people they will not be assigned to give a gift to.  This works well
for couples and maybe even people who were paired last year.  Keep in
mind that if you provide too many constraints for the number of
participants, you may leave the program without any possible matches.

In the provided example, four participants who are each excluded from
participating from one other person (Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel),
there are only two possible outcomes.
